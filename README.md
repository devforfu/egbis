# Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation Algorithm

The repository contains my attempt to implement the [Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf)
paper. The algorithm tries to build a segmentation of the image into several regions of interest depending on the variations of 
intensities of these regions relatively to the variations in adjacent segments.
